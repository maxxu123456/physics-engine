# A Physics Simulation of Colliding Balls

## Description

This is a physics engine for colliding balls. I implemented gravity, damping, collisions between balls and walls,
and collisions between balls. (GIFs run slower than in reality)

## GIFs

## Instructions to Run

First install numpy and pygame. Use the latest version of python, preferably 1.12.

Run main.py!
